## Email Sequence (3 Steps, 6 Days)

### Email 1 - Day 1 (Introduction)

**Subject:** `Quick question about cash flow at {{company}}`

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Running a {{company}} means dealing with clients who pay on their own schedule - not yours.

I built Cash Flow Forecaster specifically for agency owners and consultants who need to know exactly when money will hit their account.

Two features I think you'd find useful:
• See a visual forecast of your cash flow weeks ahead
• Send invoices with a "Pay Now" button so clients can pay instantly via Stripe

Would you be open to trying it free? No demo needed - just sign up and poke around.

### Email 2 - Day 3 (Follow-up)

**Subject:** `Re: Quick question about cash flow at {{company}}`

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just bumping this up - did you get a chance to look at Cash Flow Forecaster?

If late-paying clients or unpredictable income isn't a pain point for you, no worries at all.

But if it is, I think you'd like what we built.

### Email 3 - Day 6 (Final)

**Subject:** `Last one from me`

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Final follow-up - I'll leave you alone after this.

If you ever find yourself wondering "do I have enough cash to cover next month's bills?" - that's exactly what Cash Flow Forecaster solves.

Here's a free account if you want to try it: cashflowforecaster.io

Either way, best of luck with {{company}}.

## Expected Results

| Metric | Good | Great |
|--------|------|-------|
| Open rate | 40-50% | 60%+ |
| Reply rate | 5-10% | 15%+ |
| Positive replies | 2-3 per 25 | 5+ per 25 |

### Diagnosing Problems
- **Low open rate (<30%)**: Subject lines need work
- **Good opens, no replies**: Email body needs work
- **High unsubscribes**: Too aggressive or wrong audience

---

## Reply Handling

### If interested:
- Respond within a few hours
- Offer free Pro access for 14-30 days
- Ask about their biggest cash flow pain point
- Don't be pushy

### If not interested:
- Reply: "No problem, thanks for letting me know!"
- Don't argue or try to convince

### If asking questions:
- Answer directly and concisely
- Offer a quick call only if they ask for one

---

## Scaling Up

### After first batch results (7-10 days):

1. **If results are good:**
   - Upgrade Apollo for more leads
   - Target 100-200 leads per week
   - Consider additional industries (accountants, bookkeepers)

2. **If results are poor:**
   - A/B test subject lines
   - Try different pain points in email body
   - Review lead quality (are they actually your ICP?)

### Alternative Lead Sources
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Manually scrape from industry directories
- Content marketing (SEO, social media)
- Referrals from existing users
