### Neontra

**Price:** ~$10-15/mo (30% off annual currently)
**Approach:** Comprehensive personal finance management with forecasting

**Strengths:**

---

### Mint (Intuit)

**Website:** mint.intuit.com
**Status:** Shutting down / migrating to Credit Karma

**Notes:** Mint users are actively looking for alternatives. This is a major opportunity for user acquisition.

**Our Advantage:** Free tier available, forward-looking (Mint was backward-looking), no ads.

---

### Copilot Money

**Approach:** Apple-first design, AI categorization

**Strengths:**

---

### Flow by Acertine

**Website:** flow.acertine.com
**Price:** Free / $15/mo (Starter) / $20/mo (Professional) / Lifetime VIP option
**Approach:** Invoicing-first tool with basic cashflow overview

**Target Market:** UK Freelancers specifically (HMRC compliant)
**Our Target:** Global freelancers (currency-agnostic, multi-currency support)

**Strengths:**
- HMRC compliant invoicing (CIS deductions, VAT)
- ICO registered, GDPR compliant (strong trust signals)
- Clean, modern UI with professional invoice templates
- Stripe integration (PayPal & Dodo Payments coming)
- Quotes feature (quote → invoice conversion)
- Recurring invoices (Pro tier)
- Payment links for easy client payments
- Lifetime VIP deal option (appeals to budget-conscious freelancers)
- Good social proof ("£395K+ processed", 5.0 rating from 10 reviews)
- Basic cashflow dashboard (paid vs awaiting payment charts)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Invoicing-focused, not forecasting-focused** — Shows past/current data, not future projections
- No "Can I Afford It?" scenario testing
- No debt management tools
- No daily balance calendar
- No forward-looking forecast (90-365 days)
- More expensive ($15-20/mo vs our $7.99/mo)
- UK-only focus (HMRC compliance = UK market)
- Free tier is very limited (basic templates only)

**Our Advantage:**
- **Core differentiation:** We forecast the future; they track the past
- **Price:** 47-60% cheaper ($7.99 vs $15-20)
- **Features:** Debt payoff planner, CC payment simulator, scenario testing
- **Calendar view:** Day-by-day balance projection (they don't have this)
- **Generous free tier:** 90-day forecast with 10 bills/income vs their basic templates

**Competitive Overlap:** Low-Medium — Different primary focus. Flow = "create invoices fast", Cash Flow Forecaster = "know if you'll have money when bills hit". We both serve freelancers but solve different problems. They could become more direct competitors if they add forecasting.

**What We Can Learn From Them:**
1. Trust badges (HMRC, ICO, GDPR displayed prominently)
2. Social proof stats ("£395K+ processed")
3. User testimonials section
4. Quantified value props ("Save 90% of your time")
5. Lifetime deal option for one-time payment
6. Quotes → Invoice workflow

## Our Positioning

> "The YNAB alternative for irregular income — forward-looking instead of backward-looking."

### Key Differentiators

1. **Future-focused** — Shows predicted balance vs. competitors tracking past spending
2. **Calendar mental model** — Matches how freelancers think ("Can I pay rent on the 1st?")
3. **Invoice-to-forecast sync** — Invoices auto-populate as expected income (unique)
4. **Price** — $7.99/mo vs $14.99/mo (47% cheaper than YNAB/Monarch)
5. **Real free tier** — Not just a 14-day trial
6. **Built-in invoicing** — Runway Collect included; competitors need separate tools
7. **No bank connection required** — Manual entry works fine (reduces friction for privacy-conscious users)

### Market Gap

No competitor specifically targets **forward-looking cash flow for freelancers with irregular income**. This is our core differentiation.

## Competitor Migration Strategy

### Why Target Competitor Users?

1. **Pre-qualified** — Already paying for financial tools, understand the value
2. **Mint exodus** — Mint shutting down creates migration wave
3. **YNAB price complaints** — $14.99/mo is a common pain point on Reddit
4. **Feature gaps** — Competitors don't serve irregular income well

### What Migrating Users Need

#### Infrastructure Requirements

| Need | Current State | Priority | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Competitor CSV importers** | Generic CSV only | High | YNAB/Mint formats documented |
| **Bank sync (Canada)** | Not implemented | Medium | Flinks recommended; CDBA Phase 1 in 2026 |
| **Bank sync (US)** | Not implemented | Low | Wait for Section 1033 regulatory clarity |
| **Public API** | None | Low | Power user feature |
| **Bulk import operations** | Not available | Medium | For large migrations |
| **Native mobile app** | PWA only | Medium | Expected by switchers |

#### Feature Parity Requirements

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **YNAB/Mint/Monarch CSV importer** | High | Direct migration path |
| **Auto-categorization (AI)** | High | Reduces manual entry friction |
| **Spending analytics/trends** | Medium | YNAB users expect this |
| **Budget vs actual tracking** | Medium | YNAB's core feature |
| **Shared accounts (couples)** | Low | Infrastructure exists |

#### Support Requirements

| Need | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Migration guides** | Step-by-step docs for each competitor |
| **Concierge import service** | Do the migration for Pro users |
| **Comparison landing pages** | Expand `/compare` with honest feature matrices |
| **Trial extension** | 30-day Pro trial for users from paid competitors |
| **Community** | Discord/forum for switchers to ask questions |

### Best Migration Targets

1. **Mint refugees** — Mint is dead, they need somewhere to go (urgent opportunity)
2. **YNAB users frustrated with pricing** — $14.99/mo is steep, frequent Reddit complaints
3. **Freelancers using generic tools** — Our niche focus is compelling
4. **Neontra/Monarch users wanting forecasting** — They have basic forecasting but not calendar-based

### Migration Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Quick Wins**
- Build YNAB CSV importer (format is documented)
- Build Mint CSV importer (capture exodus)
- Create migration landing pages with guides
- Offer "migration concierge" for Pro signups

**Phase 2: Reduce Friction**
- AI-powered transaction categorization
- Spending trends/analytics charts
- Budget tracking overlay (optional)

**Phase 3: Infrastructure**
- Bank sync via Flinks (Canada first - clearer regulatory path, CDBA 2026)
- Bank sync via Plaid (US - when Section 1033 regulatory clarity improves)
- Native mobile apps (or improved PWA)
- Public API
