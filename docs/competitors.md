  Your Positioning

  "The YNAB alternative for irregular income — forward-looking instead of backward-looking."

  Key Differentiators

  1. Future-focused — Shows predicted balance vs. competitors tracking past spending
  2. Calendar mental model — Matches how freelancers think ("Can I pay rent on the 1st?")
  3. Invoice-to-forecast sync — Invoices auto-populate as expected income (unique)
  4. Price — $7.99/mo vs $14.99/mo (47% cheaper than YNAB/Monarch)
  5. Real free tier — Not just a 14-day trial
  6. Built-in invoicing — Runway Collect included; competitors need separate tools
  7. No bank connection required — Manual entry works fine

  Market Gap

  No competitor specifically targets forward-looking cash flow for freelancers with irregular income. The comparison page is at
  /app/compare/cash-flow-calendar-apps/page.tsx and detailed competitive analysis is in /docs/product-brief.md.

  Verdict: Strong Product-Market Fit

  Your app directly solves the core pain point that existing tools miss: forward-looking cash flow visibility for irregular income.

  Key differentiators that match real pain points:
  1. "Will I have enough for rent?" → Your headline literally addresses this
  2. Invoice tracking → income prediction → Runway Collect auto-syncs to forecast (unique)
  3. Calendar mental model → Matches how freelancers actually think about money
  4. Simpler than YNAB → Many complain YNAB is overkill or $14.99 is too expensive

  Gap identified: One thing I didn't see emphasized is "pay yourself a salary" functionality — this is a common strategy recommended everywhere. Could be a feature      
  opportunity.
