## Week 1 Action Plan

### Day 1-2: Get Testimonials

Contact your 3 beta testers directly. Use this template:

> Hey [Name], quick favor — would you mind sharing 2-3 sentences about your experience with Cash Flow Forecaster? Specifically: what problem does it solve for you, and would you recommend it to other freelancers?
>
> No pressure if you're not comfortable, but it would really help me understand if I'm building something valuable.

**If they say no or ghost you:** That's data. You may not have product-market fit yet.

### Day 3-4: Public Launch

1. **Indie Hackers** — Comment on relevant posts to build account credibility (new accounts can't post products immediately)
2. **Twitter/X** — Launch thread
3. **LinkedIn** — Personal post + targeted outreach
4. **Hacker News** — Show HN

**Note:** Reddit is off-limits due to ban history. Do not attempt Reddit until free channels are exhausted and you have paying customers.

### Day 5-7: Outreach & Iteration

- 10 LinkedIn conversations/day
- 10 Twitter DMs/day
- Respond to all feedback within 4 hours
- Document every objection and piece of feedback

---

## LinkedIn Outreach Messages

### Principle: Give Value First, Never Pitch

The goal is to start conversations, not close sales. You're looking for:
- Validation that the problem exists
- Understanding of how people currently solve it
- Permission to share your solution (earned, not forced)

---

### Template 1: Engaging with Someone Who Posted About Money Stress

**When to use:** Someone posts about cash flow struggles, irregular income, or financial anxiety as a freelancer.

> Really resonated with this. The "will I make rent?" anxiety is something I dealt with for years as a freelancer. What's been your go-to for getting ahead of it — spreadsheets, apps, or just hoping for the best?

**Why it works:**
- Shows empathy and shared experience
- Asks a genuine question
- No mention of your product
- Opens a conversation

**Follow-up (only if they respond and ask what you do):**

> I actually got frustrated enough that I built something for myself — a simple tool that shows my bank balance 90 days out based on my bills and expected payments. Happy to show you if you're curious, but honestly just wanted to connect with someone who gets it.

---

### Template 2: Reaching Out to Freelancers in Your Network

**When to use:** Connecting with freelancers you know or have mutual connections with.

> Hey [Name], saw you're doing [specific thing they do] — looks like it's going well! Quick question: how do you handle the cash flow unpredictability that comes with freelancing? Curious if it's something you've figured out or if it's still a pain point.

**Why it works:**
- Personalized (reference their work)
- Genuine curiosity
- Not asking for anything
- Opens door to share if relevant

---

### Template 3: Cold Outreach to Freelancers (Value-First)

**When to use:** Reaching out to freelancers you don't know.

> Hey [Name], came across your profile — [specific compliment about their work/content].
>
> Random question: I'm researching how freelancers manage the feast-or-famine income cycle. Do you have a system that works, or is it still something you're figuring out? Trying to understand if this is a universal pain or just my own struggle.

**Why it works:**
- Specific compliment shows you're not mass-messaging
- Positions you as a researcher, not a seller
- Invites them to share their experience
- No product mention

**If they respond with their struggles:**

> Yeah, that tracks with what I've heard. I actually built a small tool to solve this for myself — basically shows my projected bank balance for the next few months so I know what's actually safe to spend. Would you want to try it? Free to use, and honestly your feedback would be more valuable to me than anything.

---

### Template 4: Asking for Feedback (Existing Connections)

**When to use:** People you already know who might be in your target audience.

> Hey [Name], hope you're doing well! I've been building a side project and could really use a fresh perspective. It's a cash flow tool for freelancers — takes about 3 minutes to set up.
>
> Would you be open to trying it for a week and giving me honest feedback? Not looking for praise — I need to know what's confusing, what's missing, and whether it actually solves a problem. Totally understand if you're too busy.

**Why it works:**
- Humble and specific ask
- Emphasizes you want criticism
- Gives them an easy out
- Time-bounded commitment

---

### Template 5: Responding to "How Do You Budget?" Posts

**When to use:** Someone asks for budgeting/financial tool recommendations.

> Depends on your situation. If you have steady income, YNAB is great. If your income is irregular (freelance, gig work), that's trickier — most budgeting apps assume you know what's coming in.
>
> What's your income situation like? Happy to point you in the right direction.

**Why it works:**
- Helpful without being salesy
- Shows expertise
- Only mentions your product if they say they have irregular income
- Builds credibility

---

## What NOT to Do

### Bad Message Examples

**Too salesy:**
> Hi! I built Cash Flow Forecaster, the #1 tool for freelancers to manage their finances. Check it out at cashflowforecaster.io!

**Too generic:**
> Hey, I see you're a freelancer. I have a tool you might like.

**Too long:**
> [3 paragraphs about your product features]

**Asking for too much:**
> Would you mind signing up, using it for a month, writing a review, and sharing it with your network?

## Tracking Outreach

| Date | Platform | Person | Message Type | Response? | Outcome |
|------|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| | | | | | |

**Response rate target:** 20%+
**Conversation-to-signup target:** 10%+

---

## Weekly Check-In Questions

1. How many conversations did I start this week?
2. What objections or concerns did I hear?
3. What feature requests came up repeatedly?
4. Did anyone say they'd pay? How much?
5. Am I closer to 50 users / 5 paying / 3 testimonials?

---

## The Hard Rule

> **No new features until you have 50 active users, 5 paying customers, and 3 testimonials.**

Every hour spent coding is an hour not spent validating. The product is good enough. Now prove people want it.

---

## When to Spend Money on Distribution Tools

### The Principle

> **Your first dollar of revenue should come before your next dollar of spend.**

You're trying to validate if people will pay for your product. Spending money to reach more people is optimizing distribution before validating demand.

### Specific Case: MediaFast ($129) for Reddit Strategy

**Current situation:**
- 6 Reddit bans
- $0 revenue
- Free channels (LinkedIn, Twitter, IH) untested

**Decision: NOT YET**

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Current revenue | $0 |
| Free channels untested | LinkedIn, Twitter, IH comments |
| Reddit track record | 6 bans — platform actively rejected you |
| $129 | Real money with no validated product-market fit |

**The question isn't "how do I reach more people?"**
**It's "will anyone pay for this?"**

You can answer that with free channels first.

### When Paid Tools Make Sense

Buy distribution tools like MediaFast **AFTER** you've:

1. Gotten 3 testimonials ✗
2. Hit 25+ users from free channels ✗
3. Converted at least 1-2 paying customers ✗

At that point, $129 to scale a validated product is a no-brainer. Before that, it's $129 to maybe reach people who might not pay anyway.

### The Exception

If you try LinkedIn/Twitter hard for 2 weeks (100+ conversations) and get zero traction, then Reddit might be worth the gamble. But exhaust the free options first.

### Spending Rules

| Milestone | Then You Can Spend On |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 0 paying customers | Nothing. Use free channels only. |
| 1-2 paying customers | Small tools (<$50) to improve efficiency |
| 5+ paying customers | Distribution tools like MediaFast ($129) |
| $500+ MRR | Ads, premium tools, contractors |

---

## Channel Status

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Reddit | Blocked | 6 bans. Do not attempt until validated elsewhere. |
| Indie Hackers | Limited | New account. Build credibility via comments first. |
| LinkedIn | Available | Primary channel. Start here. |
| Twitter/X | Available | Secondary channel. Launch thread ready. |
| Hacker News | Available | Show HN post ready. |
| Apollo/Cold Email | Failed | Generated zero interest. Deprioritize. |
