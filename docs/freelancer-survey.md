## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Survey responses | 20+ |
| "I'd pay for that" answers | 5+ (25%) |
| Email signups | 10+ |
| Response rate on DMs | 30%+ |

---

## What to Do With Results

### If 25%+ say "I'd pay for that":
- You have signal. Share the product link with those people.
- Ask the email signups to try it.

### If most say "Free only":
- Pricing problem, not product problem.
- Consider longer free trial or freemium model.

### If most say "I don't need that":
- Either wrong audience or wrong positioning.
- Read the open-ended answers for clues.
