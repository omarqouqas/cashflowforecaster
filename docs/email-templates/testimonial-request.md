## Email 1: Initial Request

**Subject:** Quick favor? (2 min)

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you've been using Cash Flow Forecaster — thank you for being one of our earliest users!

I'm building this for freelancers like you, and I'd love to hear how it's working for you. Would you mind sharing a quick testimonial I could use on our website?

Just reply with:
1. **What was your biggest cash flow headache before?** (1 sentence)
2. **How has the app helped?** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Would you recommend it?** (Yes/No + why)

If you're open to it, I'd love to include your first name and what you do (e.g., "Sarah, Freelance Designer"). But anonymous is totally fine too.

As a thank you, I'll extend your account to Pro free for 3 months.

No pressure at all — if you're too busy or haven't used it much yet, no worries!

Thanks,
Omar

P.S. If something's not working or you have feedback, I'd love to hear that too. Reply anytime.

## Email 2: Follow-up (5 days later, if no response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick favor? (2 min)

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried. Would love your quick thoughts on Cash Flow Forecaster if you have 2 minutes.

Even a one-liner helps!

Thanks,
Omar
