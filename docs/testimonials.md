## Testimonials

### Daniel — Customer Success Manager

**Date Collected:** February 2026
**Permission:** Pending
**Persona:** Professional with side income / freelance background
**Source:** Direct ask via message

**Full Response:**
> "I could never see what was coming financially. Bills would sneak up on me, and I'd only find out after getting charged. The Cash Flow Calendar gives me a clear 90-day view of what's coming in and going out, so nothing catches me off guard. The import feature also saves me from manual data entry. It's intuitive, gives you a real picture of where your money stands, and takes minutes to set up."
